    <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>The Open Object Detector Challenge is a competition to train object detectors using the iOS app DetectMe. The competition consists on taking different images of objects with the DetectMe app to create an object detector. This object detector will be evaluated on a secret test set and given a grade according to its performance.<p>

      <p> There are 10 different object categories you can participate in. </p>

      <p>The objective of the competition is to find which set of images can better train an object detector. There are 10 different categories of objects to compete on.</p>

    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>The rules of the <b>Open Object Detector Challenge</b> are very
    simple. For each category, a user can submit as many
    detector as desired with only one constrain: the detector cannot be
    trained with more than 30 images.</p>

    <p>To submit a detector, a user should train a detector and name it
    starting with: "[name of the category]_competition". For instance, if one wants
    to submit his or hers table's detector, he or she should name it
    <b>table_competition</b>. After the training process, the detector will be
    automatically uploaded to our server. We strongly recommend to mark
    the detectors submitted for competition as private, otherwise they
    will be available to all the other users.</p>

    <p>Each time a user submits a detector, our system will evaluate it and
    show its performance in the leaderboard. If a user submits more than
    one detector per category, the leaderboard will only take into account
    the best of his detectors. DetectMe allows more than one detector with the same name, therefore user can have as many detectors as they want per each category. </p>

    <p>Finally, every user is free to submit detectors to as many categories
    as he want. The evaluation for prizing will be completely
    category-independent: the performance of one user will be evaluated
    separately per each different category.</p>


    <h3>Evaluation</h3>
    <p> The evaluation process will consist of a test against a large data of
    images containing objects of the different categories. Each detector
    will be tested to detect object in the images and the average
    precision of this process will be taken as the metric to evaluate its
    performance. The test set has been taken by different persons in order
    to reduce the possible bias on it.</p>


    <h3>Prizes</h3>
    <p>To be done. </p>
