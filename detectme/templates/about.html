      <p> DetectMe is a research project of the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/">MIT Computer Vision group</a> leaded by Antonio Torralba.</p>

      <p>The purpose of the project is twofold. On one hand to provide a easy to use, easy to extend object detector for iOS devices that can take away the pain of setting a vision system. With that in mind one of our main areas of applicaction is with groups on robotics to abstract their vision layer. On the other hand, we aim to construct a warehouse of object detectors. We aim to use them for research purposes for example to discover what training set produces the best object detectors.</p>

                    Josep Marc did a double major in Mathematics and Telecommunications Engineering at Centre de Formació Interdisciplinària Superior at UPC Barcelonatech. His area of expertise has been machine learning. He has
                    collaborated with LARCA group at UPC, done an internship in the analytic consultancy Neo Metrics and 
                    participated in many different data mining competitions. He has spent 2013 at MIT as a research asssistant
                    developing the DetectMe project and applying machine learning to computer vision and mobile devices.

                    My research is in the areas of computer vision, machine learning and human visual perception. I am interested in scene and object recognition, among other things.

                    Scene and object recognition are two related visual tasks generally studied separately. However, by devising systems that solve these tasks in an integrated fashion I believe it is possible to build more efficient and robust recognition systems.
